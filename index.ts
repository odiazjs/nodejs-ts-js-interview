/** HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS
 * 1.) Given a string variable, revert its letter casing and print it to the console.
 * For example if given the string 'ReVERt this StriNG' the expected output
 * should be 'rEverT THIS sTRIng'
 * Conditions: Do not use a for loop or the .forEach utility function,
 * you must use the .map() array operator.
 */

const sText = 'LETS INVERT the CasE in THIS sTRING';
const result = [];
const invertString = (char) => {
  // your code here
};

/** ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMMING
 * 2.) Given a function doAsync(), write code inside this function
 * that logs to the console a parameter called 'word' from an outside function after 2 seconds
 */

const doAsync = (/** ? */) => {
  // your code here
};

/** OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
 * 3.) Write a typescript class Robot that is generic so that you can
 * create varios Robots of different companies [SpaceX, DynamicIndustries, GenericProtos], and that implements an IMobility interface that contains basic human motions like walk, run, jump. Lastly create 2 types of Robots with different IMobility implementations.
